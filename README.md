**A/B Testing for Improving Subscription Conversions in a Mobile App**

**Goal:** To increase premium subscription conversion rate by analyzing how users react to the current and alternative subscription screens.

**Method and Tools:** Data analysis with Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels), A/B test planning (hypothesis, metric selection, sample size), statistical hypothesis testing with z-test, comparison of conversion rates with 95% confidence intervals, time series chart for daily conversion trends.

**Results:** The alternative screen with a “50% discount” message had a higher and statistically significant conversion rate (8.9% vs 6.1%, p < 0.05). The new screen was recommended for all users.

**Skills Gained:** Planning and running A/B tests, using z-test and interpreting p-values, analyzing data with confidence intervals, visualizing and reporting results with Python, supporting product decisions based on data.
